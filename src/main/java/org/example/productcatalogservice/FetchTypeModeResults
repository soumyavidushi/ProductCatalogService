 Summary ->

 FetchMode JOIN is dominant over all cases. It doesn't honor any fetchtype

 In case of FetchMode Select and Subselect, FetchType is honored, that means we will not get child
 entity in case of lazy loading.

 In  case of FetchMode Select and Subselect , 2 select queries from product and category table, even though join would
 have ran.
